# FusionAuth Code Challenge

Welcome to the FusionAuth Code Challenge! This challenge will help you familiarize yourself with FusionAuth by setting up a local instance and enhancing a basic application. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Challenge Overview

### Action Item 1: Quickstart and Local Setup

**FusionAuth Quickstart**: 
   - Go through a [FusionAuth quickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/) in the language of your choice (choose from one of the **web application** options, not the 5-minute/mobile/SPA/API quickstarts).
   - Set up a local FusionAuth instance running on port 9011 with a basic application.

1. **Enhance the Application**:
   - Add a page in the app that allows a user to add additional data like a nickname, favorite snack, hobby, or any other data points.
   - Store these values in the `FusionAuth` `user.data` object.
_Hint: Use FusionAuth‚Äôs custom data fields and ensure proper validation and storage._

2. **Implement 2Factor Authentication**:
   - Implement Two-Factor Authentication using FusionAuth. Users should be able to enable or disable 2FA from their profile settings, and if enabled, they should be prompted for a second authentication factor on login.
_Hint: Explore FusionAuth‚Äôs multi-factor authentication features and integrate with an TOTP (Time Based One-Time Password) provider._

3. **Implement a Role-Based Access Control system.**
  - Create roles such as ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù, ‚ÄúEditor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúViewer‚Äù, and restrict access to certain parts of your application based on the user‚Äôs role.
_Hint: Use FusionAuth‚Äôs role management and authorization features._
